# Skeet-Game
This was the first game I help create. Two other classmates and I were asked to create a skeet shooting game.
The game was to have a rifle in the bottom right hand corner and fire bullets with a certain set of rules. Each hit
of a skeet was increase the score. This project was created in C++ using Xcode.

The lack of commits seen from my profile were due to my limited knowledge of version control. Any individual
contributions from me can't be seen, as I used the unreliable and unsecure method of emailing the files to my partners
and they committed the files to github.
